### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_
- **Bonus:** Dark mode toggle

### What I learned

Building this project has provided me with valuable learning experiences. One of the challenges I encountered was implementing email validation using JavaScript, which involved learning about regular expressions and how to validate user input.

Overall, this project has helped me to build on my existing knowledge and gain new insights.

### Useful resources

- [RegexMagic](https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html) - This article by <b>Jan Goyvaerts</b> provides an in-depth explanation of how to use regular expressions to validate email addresses. The article not only explains how to write regular expressions for email validation but also covers the common mistakes made while writing regular expressions for email validation.

It provides clear and concise examples of regular expressions for email validation and also explains the logic behind each regular expression.
